Golang project to create terraform helper utility

Terraform is an awesome way to create infrastructure. The DSL is 
very easy to pick up, and there are abundant examples, as well 
as a decent number of modules.

I wanted to simplify it ever so much for operators and not 
 _require_ them to be able to read and write terrafrom code. 
I also put in pieces that are my opinionated version of best 
practices.
